# -Manufacturing-Analytics-Project-for-Axon-labels
## ðŸ”¹Project Objective
Manufacturing Analytics Project for Axon labels is about to design and develop interactive dashboards in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau to monitor key manufacturing KPIs. The dashboards provide actionable insights into production efficiency, rejection analysis, cost trends, and delivery performance, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ”¹About KPIs

â€¢ The dashboards focus on the following KPIs:

â€¢ Production Quantity â€“ Total manufactured output across departments and machines.

â€¢ Rejection Quantity & % â€“ Items rejected during production to assess quality performance.

â€¢ Achievement % â€“ Actual output achieved compared to planned targets.

â€¢ Loss Value â€“ Financial impact of rejected items on overall production cost.

â€¢ Delivery Performance â€“ Timeliness and efficiency in meeting delivery schedules.

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains manufacturing work orders, production details, and rejection reports across departments and machines.

## ðŸ”¹ Process

1. Data Preparation

   Queried and created tables in MySQL for structured storage.

   Cleaned and transformed data using Excel formulas, Power Query, and SQL joins.

2. Data Modeling

   Built calculated measures (DAX in Power BI, calculated fields in Tableau).

   Defined KPIs to measure production efficiency and quality.

3. Dashboard Development

   Designed Excel dashboard with PivotTables, charts, and slicers.

   Built Power BI dashboard with interactive visuals and drill-downs.
   
   Created Tableau dashboard with parameters, filters, and geographical maps.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Insights

â€¢ Highlighted rejection patterns across departments and machines.

â€¢ Detected performance gaps in production vs. target outputs.

â€¢ Identified cost-saving opportunities by analyzing loss values.

â€¢ Enabled stakeholders to drill down into machine-level, department-level, and time-based performance.

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL to build end-to-end BI solutions. The dashboards successfully transform raw manufacturing data into meaningful insights, supporting quality control, cost management, and operational efficiency.
